## This is finally something I’ll have done.

I have told myself that I would make a personal website since I became interested in computer science 4 years ago. Back then I thought that a personal site would be a rock upon which I could build and show off all the cool side projects I was working on. The site would balloon and improve and, over time, would become an immutable record of my progress as a developer.

I quickly shoved myself in a completely different direction, and the idea of a personal site was pushed to the back of my mind. Another nebulous **side project** that I would get to at some point.

4 years ago, was when I started University to do a Computing Science degree. There have been a lot of aspects that interested me, only to become the kernel of an idea that went nowhere.

I was being introduced to a new area of computing every few months and a new concept every day, and at the same time trying desperately to crystallize some core interest or *specialty* that would be the direction I would go in within the field of software development. I think that after 4 years of a new hobby every few weeks, my interests are starting to settle slightly. Hopefully some of them will creep onto this site as projects.

I don’t know what this blog will be, or even what the site will be yet. But, I’m happy that I’m finally doing it.
