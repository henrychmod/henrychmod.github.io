## Hi, im Henry. 

#### I'm a UK based *software developer* that occasionally develops software. When I'm not doing that I'm usually taking something apart or trying to put it back together.

I'm interested in robotics, IoT, embedded systems and just about any situation that means I get to write software for hardware. This most often manifests as a love for modding mechanical keyboards, also using them, for just about anything.

######I also love to *write*. 

Hopefully, this site means I'll have more opportunities to do that.
