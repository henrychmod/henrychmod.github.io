<h2> Hi, im Henry. </h2>

<h4> I'm a UK based <em> software developer </em> that occasionally develops software. When I'm not doing that I'm usually taking something apart or trying to put it back together. </h4>


<p> I'm interested in robotics, IoT, embedded systems and just about any situation that means I get to write software for hardware. This most often manifests as a love for modding mechanical keyboards, also using them, for just about anything. </p>

<h6> I also love to <em> write </em>. </h6> 

<p> Hopefully, this site means I'll have more opportunities to do that. </p>
