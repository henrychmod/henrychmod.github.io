	<h2> Hello, im Henry. </h2>

	<p> I'm a UK based software developer that occasionally develops software. When I'm not doing that I'm usually taking something apart or trying to put it back together. </p>

	<p> I'm interested in robotics, IoT, embedded systems and just about any situation that means I get to write software for hardware. This most often manifests as a love for modding mechanical keyboards, also using them, for just about anything. </p>

	<p> I also love to write.</p> 

	<p> Hopefully, this site means I'll have more opportunities to do that. </p>
